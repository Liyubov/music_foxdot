# Music generation foxdot
Code for generation of electronic music using FoxDot https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot

# Main programs

1. Generation of test files
2. Exploration of network using random walk and generation of music according to which edge a random walk takes 

# Music for robots
Generation of random music based on RNNs. The main idea is simple: we want to train a RNN model on music dataset (in sequential format of time-series), and then use that trained model to generate a new song (time-series). We'll train our RNN using batches of song snippets from previous song (train dataset). 
This is work in progress.
